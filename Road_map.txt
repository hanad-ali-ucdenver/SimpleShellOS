✅ 1. Problem Definition (20 pts)
What to include:

A clear problem statement: 
"To design and implement a simple shell that can create, manage, and terminate processes using system calls in Linux (or Windows)."

Relevance: Discuss how process management is a core concept in operating systems and how this shell demonstrates those principles.

✅ 2. Algorithm Implementation (40 pts)
What evaluators look for:

Well-structured and commented code.

Proper use of fork(), exec(), and wait() .

Handling edge cases (e.g., what if exec fails? What if the user types an invalid command?).

Support for built-in commands like exit, cd, etc., can also earn bonus points.

✅ 3. Simulation and Visualization (40 pts)
This might not be as straightforward for a shell, but here's what you could do:

Logging: Show each process's lifecycle (creation, execution, termination) in a log or terminal output.

Text-based timeline or table: Simulate a Gantt-like view of processes started, their PIDs, and status updates.

Optional: Use ASCII art or a simple Python/JavaScript GUI to visualize process states.

✅ 4. Analysis of Results (40 pts)
Discuss:

How efficiently your shell creates and terminates processes.

Metrics like time taken to execute processes (simple timing).

Any race conditions or zombie process handling.

Compare with how a full shell like bash might handle similar tasks.

✅ 5. Recent Research Component (40 pts)
Suggested additions:

Include a section on modern research or developments in process management (e.g., containerization using namespaces and cgroups in Linux).

Discuss advancements in shell design (like job control, modern shell scripting improvements, or concurrency models).

Cite 1-2 recent academic or industry sources.

✅ 6. Presentation and Documentation (20 pts)
Include:

A well-structured report or README.

Code comments and usage instructions.

Proper formatting, grammar, and visual elements in your report.
